Hey everyone,

This is just a funny little joke function I made parodying the functions `toupper` and `tolower` in R.

`tomixed` will change each character in a text string to either uppercase or lowercase, randomly.

`tomixed2` will change each character in a text string to either uppercase if that letter occupies an even numbered position in the text string or to lowercase if that character occupies an odd numbered position.

Pretty simple function, feel free to copy and paste the code into R to have fun toying around with it.
